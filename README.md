# YouTube Shorts Redirect Userscript

## Description
This userscript is designed to redirect YouTube Shorts URLs to play the content as a standard video instead of as a short. The script detects the presence of 'shorts' in the URL and automatically replaces it with 'watch', enabling the video to play in its regular format.

## How it Works
The userscript monitors the current URL for the 'shorts' string. Upon detection, it modifies the URL, replacing 'shorts' with 'watch', ensuring that the video content is played as a standard YouTube video.

## Usage
1. Install a userscript manager extension like Tampermonkey in your browser.
2. Create a new userscript and paste the provided code.
3. Save the script and ensure it's enabled within the userscript manager.

## Compatibility
This script is designed to function with URLs containing 'shorts' on YouTube. It supports both HTTP and HTTPS variations of YouTube URLs.
