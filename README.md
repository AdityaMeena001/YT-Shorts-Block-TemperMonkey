# YouTube Shorts Redirect Userscript

## How it Works
The userscript monitors the current URL for the 'shorts' string. Upon detection, it modifies the URL, replacing 'shorts' with 'watch', ensuring that the video content is played as a standard YouTube video.

## Usage
1. Install a userscript manager extension like Tampermonkey in your browser.
2. Create a new userscript and paste the provided code.
3. Save the script and ensure it's enabled within the userscript manager.
